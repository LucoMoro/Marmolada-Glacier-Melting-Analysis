# Glacier Melting Analysis Project: Marmolada Glacier

This repository hosts the data and analysis scripts for the Glacier Melting Analysis Project focused on the Marmolada Glacier in Italy. This project is part of a course on Geographical Information Systems conducted by Professor Sebillo at the [University of Salerno](https://www.unisa.it/). 
The work is a collaborative academic effort by [Dario Mazza](https://github.com/xDaryamo) and [Luca Morelli](https://github.com/LucoMoro) to investigate the impact of climate change on the retreat of the Marmolada Glacier using satellite imagery and climate data.

## Project Overview

Leveraging Google Earth Engine (GEE) and QGIS, this project aims to visualize and quantify changes in the glacier coverage over time and correlate these changes with global climate indicators such as temperature variations and CO2 emissions. The analysis provides an in-depth look at the effects of climate change on one of the most iconic glaciers in the Italian Alps.

## Technologies

- **QGIS**: For spatial data analysis and visualization.
- **Google Earth Engine**: For processing satellite imagery and extracting NDSI data.
- **Python**: For automation of data processing tasks.

## Data

The dataset encompasses annual NDSI raster images from 1985 to 2020, along with associated temperature, precipitation, and CO2 emissions data. This information is derived from the Landsat 5, 7, and 8 satellite missions, complemented by ECMWF ERA5 daily climate reanalysis.

## Installation

Clone the project repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LucoMoro/Marmolada_NDSI.git
